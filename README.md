# HandPiano
Simple Midi Piano to play using finger gestures using opencv

## Add Following packages in your project
Note: **pip** should be available on your system inorder to install packages using **pip**.
## Open-cv
```python 
pip install opencv-python
```
Opencv is used in this project to capture video (in this case from webcam).<br>
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that provides a collection of algorithms and tools for building real-time computer vision applications. It is designed to be cross-platform and can run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. OpenCV is widely used for a range of computer vision tasks, such as object detection and recognition, face detection, tracking, image segmentation, and more.

## Mediapipe
```python
pip install mediapipe
```
Mediapipe is use to detect the hand gestures from the video/images captured by opencv using a pre-trained hand model.<br>
MediaPipe provides a collection of pre-built and customizable machine learning models and tools for building computer vision and audio applications. It simplifies the development of perceptual applications by offering high-performance, cross-platform tools that allow developers to easily build, deploy, and iterate on their ML-based applications. It supports a variety of input sources and can output results in various formats. 

## Pygame
```python
pip install pygame
```
Pygame is used for adding midi piano sounds.<br>
Pygame is a Python library that provides a collection of modules for developing video games and multimedia applications. It is built on top of the SDL library and allows developers to create 2D games, graphics, and sound effects. Pygame provides a wide range of functionalities, such as image and sound loading, input handling, collision detection, animation, and more, making it a popular choice for developing games and interactive multimedia applications in Python.
